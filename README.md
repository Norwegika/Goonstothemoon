This morning, I was talking with my dad and my cousin Theresa about AI, when I got an idea.
I always have tons of ideas for games, but I'm very bad at coding. So I decided to use one of my old game ideas to make...
Goons to the moon! I used Chat GPT-3 to make it and polished the code with my limited knowledge of javascript, watched a few youtube tutorials, and here we are.

Goons to the moon is a very simple game that revolves areound the fact that humanity sucks and our planet is dying so we need to send humans to the moon to have a second option.
You can send smart, heavy, scrappy, light, or normal goons to the moon and have them harvest moon dust to make money. In the future the game will have an actual story,
but for now it's just the basic gameplay. 

Enjoy! -Norwegika (April 23rd, 2023)
